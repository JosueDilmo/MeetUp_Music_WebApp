# Meet Up Music Web Application
The objective of this project is to create a space where artists can announce where they will perform and also join an ongoing Busking (event).<br>
When an Artist/User join an ongoing event, an online chat with the others who have joined the specific event is possible, making easier for them to communicate specific things about the performance.
